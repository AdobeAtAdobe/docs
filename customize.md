# <a name="how" class="anchor">Style</a>
 
Jekyll transforms plain text into static websites and blogs. Here, we will briefly cover how to override Jekyll's style.

### <a name="sass" class="anchor">SASS</a>

Our installation uses SASS for styles. The [Jekyll Cayman Theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) is our base style and we have overriden some styles in the _assets/css/style.scss file. You can also add any of your modifications there.

### <a name="images" class="anchor">Images and Other Assets</a>

All images can be placed in the images directory under a logical organizational structure, as needed. If you have videos, you can create a videos directory and it should be likewise detected and added to the generated web content. You can learn how to reference images in the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

### <a name="jekyll" class="anchor">Jekyll</a>
